# A Course on "Statistical Cosmology using Python: From Beginner to Advanced"


This course provides an introduction to the Python language and its application in cosmology. It covers an overview of the many tools available for writing and executing Python, as well as getting learners started coding pretty quickly. This course may be more comprehensive than other beginners Python-based statistical cosmology since it explores deeper into several key programming concepts in cosmology.
